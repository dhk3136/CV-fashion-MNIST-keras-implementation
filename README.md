# A keras implementation of fashion-MNIST

### Overview:  
MNIST is to datasets what CNNs are to Computer Vision. Both have been indispensible with regard to progress in the discipline. MNIST has every implementation, baseline, and fine-tuned model in CV in its arsenal. Practioners have left no stone unturned with MNIST. This means 1) MNIST is an outstanding dataset that will go down historically in Machine Learning as a major factor in advancing the discipline to its heretofore highest levels. 2) MNIST has a shelf life. No longer are new benchmarks a special achievement since its standing metrics have very, very little room for improvement at this point.

According to ML researchers, despite MNIST's widespread influence over practioners and students alike, there must be calls for variations to the dataset in order for research to aim toward more difficult targets.  
One such variation is the fashion-MNIST dataset. Instead of the familiar pixels of handwritten digits, now the challenge is to classify clothing items which share very little in common in terms of form. The challenge holds true for machines which cannot rely on contextual similarity in terms of form--or uniformity--of figures.  

This implementation which uses keras and the fashion-MNIST dataset. Its purpose is to set up an initial baseline for my further inquiry and to improve what I've established here.  

### Data
Since I've already denoted the import of the fashion-MNIST dataset, I'll now jump into the finer-grained details.  

The dataset includes XXXXX number of rows and columns. Here's an initial look:
